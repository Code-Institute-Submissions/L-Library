######Milstone Project 2: Interacted Fronted Development - Code Institute

The project is made for general audience to use the site as inspirational and motivational start,
continuing with confidently using it as a source of knowledge, or to benefit one’s studies,
or to have some fun reading.

##UX

As the site was built to meet simple aims of communication and information, the structure is simple
and meeting the needs of those working on study projects as well as those who consider being just a reader.

##User Stories

User 1:
Me and my friends have a book club and we meet once a month to disscuss the books we are reading or read already, sometimes we go on playing mind games about books or writers.
I think the application like this would help us in any arguments as the search of books and authors gives the basic and quick results.

User 2:
I am a freelance writer and sometimes have to use a quick search just to confirm my assumptions on titles or authors, this site gives me an opportunity to easy find an answer.

User 3:
I am a passionate reader and this application is useful as sometimes I like to explore particular theme or subject matter and a keyword search let me find the books that I am interested in just by one click.

User 4:
I noticedd it is very easy to use the site on a smartphone and i am excited to play around with it on my daily commute.

##Strategy

The goal in the design was to make it easy to navigate as well as to fill it with a useful features
(like adding advanced search or help form) and information for users.

##Scope

The site is structured to easily navigate the world of literature as well as find particular subject one searches for.

##Structure

The site structure is based on ergonomics, 
so it is to take the customer to the information one’s searching without having to scroll through
any unnecessary documents, reading texts that are advertising or filing the forms that appear to be unnecessary. 

##Sceleton

Using Balsamiq these wireframes were created to open up the idea how the site looks like in three sizes of screens.
