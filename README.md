###### Milstone Project 2: Interacted Fronted Development - Code Institute

The project is made for general audience to use the site as inspirational and motivational start,
continuing with confidently using it as a source of knowledge, or to benefit one’s studies,
or to have some fun reading. The site is for the users to find quick and easy answers, when he/she wants to find a book using only a keyword.
The user can also search for presents as books when they know the theme or subject matter that person is interested in.
There is a form to fill or the links of social media to use and other options for user to contact the site so he/she can report the issue on a site or get any other answer to any detailed question.

## UX

As the site was built to meet simple aims of communication and information, the structure is simple
and meeting the needs of those working on study projects as well as those who consider being just a reader.
The navigation is simple in leading the user through the site and the whole structure is not overcrowded for user to get the expectd result straight away.

## User Stories

User 1:
Me and my friends have a book club and we meet once a month to disscuss the books we are reading or read already, sometimes we go on playing mind games about books or writers.
I think the application like this would help us in any arguments as the search of books and authors gives the basic and quick results.

User 2:
I am a freelance writer and sometimes have to use a quick search just to confirm my assumptions on titles or authors, this site gives me an opportunity to easy find an answer.

User 3:
I am a passionate reader and this application is useful as sometimes I like to explore particular theme or subject matter and a keyword search let me find the books that I am interested in just by one click.

User 4:
I noticedd it is very easy to use the site on a smartphone and i am excited to play around with it on my daily commute.

## Strategy

The goal in the design was to make it easy to navigate as well as to fill it with a useful features
(like adding advanced search or help form) and information for users.

## Scope

The site is structured to easily navigate the world of literature as well as find particular subject one searches for.

## Structure

The site structure is based on ergonomics, 
so it is to take the customer to the information one’s searching without having to scroll through
any unnecessary documents, reading texts that are advertising or filing the forms that appear to be unnecessary. 

## Sceleton

Using Balsamiq these wireframes were created to open up the idea how the site looks like in three sizes of screens.

## Surface

The colour palette that was chosen for the project is deliberately contrasting and quite modest in the shades used. Pinterest platform is used to find out matching colour palette.

CSS – to create visually pleasant web page.
JavaScript – to make it more interactive.
API
jSon
Bootstrap – to make it responsive.
Balsamiq – to create sketches of a future site.


## Features

 ## Existing Features
    As mentioned above the features of the project are quite modest to meet the goal of simplicity and encourage the users to find the answers quick and easy.
    1. Navigation with a smooth scrolling is made for users to get to the section they search for.
    2. The search uses keywords as a trigger and gets the user five responses that he can continue to manipulate.
    3. The help form invites the regular user to report an issue if there is one, but as lets the user to send an email message it can be anything.
    4. The footer is used to put the contact and social media information for purposes of overall decency of aesthetics and to give a user an option to find further information of creators and site administrators.


## Features left to implement

The features that have to be added is: a possibility to chat (between members, or getting online consultation), 
possibility of becoming a member (that can be done just by signing in), 
possibility of becoming a sponsor or advanced member (that have to pay for membership and have some advanced benefits) or  patreon.
In the forseeable future this site overall can be(and hopfully will be) added to the bigger project as a feature itself.

## Deployement

This site was created using Gitpod and deployed to GitHub pages. The landing page has to be index.html, to correctly deploy it to GitHub.

## Acknowledgments

There were many sources used to create this website, such as openlibrary.org/developers/api, w3schools.com, getbootstrap.com, courses.codeinstitute.com. I also read some material in the websites like pinterest or Wikipedia.
Have to add that this project would not be possible without my mentor Aaron Sinnott, Code Institute tutors and Slack.
