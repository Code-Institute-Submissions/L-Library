######Milstone Project 2: Interacted Fronted Development - Code Institute

continuing with confidently using it as a source of knowledge, or to benefit one’s studies,
or to have some fun reading.

and meeting the needs of those working on study projects as well as those who consider being just a reader.

(like adding advanced search or help form) and information for users.

##Scope

The site is structured to easily navigate the world of literature as well as find particular subject one searches for.

##Structure

The site structure is based on ergonomics, 
so it is to take the customer to the information one’s searching without having to scroll through
any unnecessary documents, reading texts that are advertising or filing the forms that appear to be unnecessary.
